* Led the development of a reusable framework to orchestrate and monitor machine learning models in PySpark
* Designed a PySpark framework that simplifies a complex data engineering pipeline which generates a Feature Store of over 160 features
* Led and mentored a team of 5 developers by providing technical guidance and steer
* Led technical client engagements with senior data scientists to gather and formalise requirements


#### **Data Architect & Business Analyst, UK Telecommunications**
Accenture Applied Intelligence,
_November 2020 - January 2022_

This project was part of a larger programme to migrate an existing Teradata system to an Enterprised Data Hub powered by open source tools. The project focused on designing Batch pipelines to enable the client to personalise marketing campaigns and orchestrate customer journeys.

Tech Stack: Apache Hive (HiveQL - similar to SQL), Apache Hadoop, Data Analytics Studio, MS Excel
