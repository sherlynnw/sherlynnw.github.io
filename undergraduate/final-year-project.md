## Exploring Spatio-Temporal prediction of PM2.5 Concentration

This was my first ever Python project with no prior knowledge. The repository is accessible upon request.

In this research, a spatial and temporal machine learning framework was implemented to predict hourly PM2.5 concentrations. A spatial inferencing method was also proposed to infer fine-grained PM2.5 concentrations in the city. The model was trained using data collected in the city of Beijing between June and July 2018. This thesis will include related works, a description of the dataset, a description of the implemented framework, results and findings of a series of experiments related to the framework, a discussion of the results and finally a description of the proposed spatial inferencing method. Throughout this research, a combination of open source computer programmes were used: scikit-learn, Pytorch, scipy, XGBoost and Matplotlib (Chen & Guestrin, 2016; Collobert, Bengio & Marithoz, 2002; Hunter, 2007; Jones, Oliphant & Peterson, 2001; Pedregosa et al., 2011).
