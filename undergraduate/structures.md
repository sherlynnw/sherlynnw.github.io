## Modelling and Optimising Sway Structures

In this assignment, a multi-storey and multi-bay truss and frames were modelled using MATLAB to understand the stability and failure mechanism when subjected to horizontal forces.

To stabilise the truss, a diagonal cross-member was introduced to each storey. The arrangement and orientation of the cross-members were optimised to ensure the smallest possible lateral sway of the structure and the optimum cross-sectional area of the cross-members were calculated.
