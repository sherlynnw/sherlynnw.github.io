Hi there! I'm Sher Lynn, a client-facing Machine Learning Engineer born and raised in Malaysia, currently based in London. I graduated from Imperial College London with an MEng in Civil Engineering and have worked in the Technology field since January 2020. With my less-than-conventional career path into Machine Learning Engineering, I hope to be able to shed some light on the endless career possibilities within Technology and more specifically Data & AI to young women, ethnic minorities and the underprivileged.
